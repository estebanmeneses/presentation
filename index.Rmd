# **Origins**

.pull-left[

- Big Bang around 13.8 billion years (Energy, matter, Space, and time)


- Single densest sphere 


- How can we know this?


- What was before?


- How space rocks formed? (4.5 billons years) (from heavier)

# **Classification**

.pull-left[

- Asteroids (biggest)

# Group assignment

- Solar system.

- We are going to make 3 groups each one one has to present one of the main space rocks (Asteroid, Comets, and Meteoroids).

- Have to tell us about 3 things:

  - What are they made of?
  - Where they come from?
  - Its main classification.
  
You have 15 minutes to search and 2 minutes to present.

# **Asteroids (star-like)**

They are rocky, metallic or both, orbiting around the sun in between Mars and Jupiter (main belt). Classified as:


.pull-left[

- 75% carbon based (c-type).

- 17% are silicon based (s-type).

- 8% Miscellaneous (iron, nickel, and others - m-type).

- Some have moons.

*Ceres (400 km in radius)

---
# **Comets**

.pull-left[

- Signs for predictions.

- Comets are a balance mixture of ice and rock. 

- Solid part called nucleus and gas tail called coma

- Comets have 2 tails: the gas tail and the dust tail.
]

*Halley's Comet

# **Comets**

.pull-left[

Comets are classified by their orbits:

- Short period comets (< 200 years). 
  
  - Orbits as planets.
  - From scatter disk.

- Long-term comets (> 200 years).

  - They can appear everywhere.
  - From Oort cloud.

## **Where they go?**

--

- They evaporate becoming in asteroids

## **Can they hit the Earth?**

--

- Yes (live formed)

*Pluto is in the Kuiper belt object.

# **What is a shooting star?**

.white[



- Meteors have a huge amount of kinetic energy.

- As they hit our atmosphere they slow down.

- All that energy has to go somewhere.

- That energy is converted in light and heat.

## **Where meteors come from?**

--

- From asteroids.

### **What about meteors showers?**

--

- They come from comet debris. 

- Named after the constellation.

- They are easy to see (after midnight).

# **Bolides or fireball**

.pull-left[

- These are extremely bright meteors.

- Sometime the pressure breaks them raining dozens or hundreds.

- They don't cause fires.
